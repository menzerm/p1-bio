			<h2>Major: Visual Communication Design</h2>

				<p>A major in Visual Communication Design educates and prepares students to conceive and create creative solutions to satisfy the visual communication needs of society. Graduates are prepared for careers in graphic design, Web design, multimedia design, advertising, printing, publishing, or related fields. Theory and practice are covered in a variety of contexts, including process and product, form and content, type and image, and interactivity. Current technology and future trends are addressed in the context of industry practices. This major is combined with a related minor in another academic area to specialize in specific career preparation.</p>

			<h2>Personal Background</h2>

				<p>I was born and raised in the evergreen state otherwise known as Washington. My father made it a priority for me to know how to use computers from a very young age, so it is fair to say computers have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. </p>

			<h2>Professional Objectives</h2>

				<p>I have a passion for design. I have made it a personal goal to help make the world a prettier place with my designs, illustrations, and other artworks.</p>
